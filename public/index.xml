      <description>Introduction Profile regression is a clustering technique which links the clusters to an outcome of interest via a regression model. It differs from traditional distance-based clustering techniques in that it uses a stochastic model-based approach.
In general, models are fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods, which outputs a different partition of the data at each iteration of the sampler.
The aim of this article is to compare the performance of profile regression to other clustering methods, such as Hierarchical clustering, K-Means, K-mode and Latent Class Analysis.</description>

      <description>Currently, I am a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, working at the MRC - Biostatistics Unit. My research focuses on developing probabilistic clustering methods for the identification of multimorbidities in the English population.
Prior to this, I graduated with a PhD in Applied Probability from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. There I worked on in an area of applied probability called the theory of Large Deviations, which estimates the probabilities of rare events occuring in different systems.</description>
