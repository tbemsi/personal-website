Currently, I am a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, working at the [MRC - Biostatistics Unit](https://mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk). My research focuses on developing probabilistic clustering methods for the identification of multimorbidities in the English population. 

Prior to this, I graduated with a PhD in Applied Probability from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk) in Edinburgh. There I worked on in an area of applied probability called the theory of Large Deviations, which estimates the probabilities of rare events occuring in different systems. I applied this theory to different queuing systems.
